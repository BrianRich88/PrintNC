Welcome to my PrintNC github repo!

9/2/2024 - All information from my website will be moved to this github repo instead. Some of it will be cleaned up as well, as a lot has changed in the past 3 years. I hope to keep as much info as I can to help those build in the future.

I've just recently downsized my V3 to a V4 Desktop and am moving to a FlexiHal/IO Sender setup as well. I will try to update this repo to the best of my ability as things change.
